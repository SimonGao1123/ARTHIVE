App to track and log books, movies and tv shows, cultural journal with suggestions for new media based on what you liked
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Users who read books, watch movies, and follow TV shows require multiple platforms to track reviews for the media they consume.
HOW MIGHT WE: How might we design a single app that lets people easily track books, movies, and TV in one place so users can reflect on their media experiences without having to switch between apps?
